<p><strong>Exercise 1:
</strong></p>



<p>Write a shell script that prints "Shell Scripting is Fun!" to the screen.
</p>



<p>Hint 1:

Remember to make the shell script executable with the chmod command.
</p>



<p>Hint 2:

Remember to start your script with a shebang!
</p>



<p><strong>Exercise 2:
</strong></p>



<p>Modify the shell script from exercise 1 to include a variable. The variable will hold the contents
of the message "Shell Scripting is Fun!".
</p>



<p><strong>Exercise 3:
</strong></p>



<p>Store the output of the command "hostname" in a variable. Display "This script is running on
_______." where "_______" is the output of the "hostname" command.
</p>



<p>Hint:

It's a best practice to use the ${VARIABLE} syntax if there is text or characters that directly
precede or follow the variable.
</p>



<p><strong>Exercise 4:
</strong></p>



<p>Write a shell script to check to see if the file "/etc/shadow" exists. If it does exist, display
"Shadow passwords are enabled." Next, check to see if you can write to the file. If you can,
display "You have permissions to edit /etc/shadow." If you cannot, display "You do NOT have
permissions to edit /etc/shadow."
</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 5:
</strong></p>



<p>Write a shell script that displays "man", "bear", "pig", "dog", "cat", and "sheep" to the screen with
each appearing on a separate line. Try to do this in as few lines as possible.
</p>



<p>Hint: Loops can be used to perform repetitive tasks.
</p>



<p><strong>Exercise 6:
</strong></p>



<p>Write a shell script that prompts the user for a name of a file or directory and reports if it is a
regular file, a directory, or other type of file.

Also perform an ls command against the file or directory with the long listing option.
</p>



<p><strong>Exercise 7:
</strong></p>



<p>Modify the previous script so that it accepts the file or directory name as an argument instead of
prompting the user to enter it.
</p>



<p><strong>Exercise 8:
</strong></p>



<p>Modify the previous script to accept an unlimited number of files and directories as arguments.
Hint: You'll want to use a special variable.
